<p>We have used Naive bayes algorithm and support vector machine to train the sample enron data having about 15000 each spam and non spam(ham) data</p>
<p>The data set can be downloaded from here http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/ which is around 52.8 MB</p>
<p>The accuracy measured for Naive bayes implementation is about 99.08% for about 30% of random data from preprocessed data which was not used for training</p>
